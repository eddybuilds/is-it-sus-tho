# Is It Sus Tho?

#### Work in Progress!

Tool to check how genuine NFT initial buyers are.

`is-it-sus-tho` analyses the buyers of an NFT collection, previous relationships between eachother and with the collection owners, and identifies any red flags that indicate the project is risky. 

Essentially a credit score for an NFT project based on the admittedly limited data we have available to us. 

Have an idea on a possible red flag? Something sus that should be taken into account? Add an issue, I'll review it, and add it to the algorithm.

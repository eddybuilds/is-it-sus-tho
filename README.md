# is-it-sus-tho
Tool to check how genuine NFT initial buyers are 

`is-it-sus-tho` analyses the buyers of an NFT collection, previous relationships between eachother and with the collection owners, and identifies any red flags that indicate the project is risky. 

Essentially a credit score for an NFT project based on the admittedly limited data we have available to us. 

WIP!
